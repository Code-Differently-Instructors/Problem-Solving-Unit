## Prerequisites
- Programmatic Thinking
- Problem Solving

## The Set Up
- Clone or fork this repository to your Github or you can create a new repository on your Github.
- In the new repository, create a new file called `Tic-Tac-Toe.md`
- Copy and paste directions from lab into new file.
- Make sure you are saving along the way.
- Complete the prompt below.
  
## About
Tic Tac Toe is an age old game which is rooted in decision making and conditions. This will be interesting because you'll need to think about and detail your pseudo code a bit more.  

## The Task
In this activity we are stepping away from programming the instructor and now you will be planning to program the computer. Tic Tac Toe is a decision/conditional based game with a board. You may be thinking this is simple, but it might be a little more challenging than you think. An example would be if player 1 chooses to put X in the first square on row 1 and player 2 puts X in the second square in row 2, how would you pseudo code this scenario. This is the type of programmatic thinking that is needed when developing such a program. 

**Here are some guidelines below to think about:**

### Part 1: The Board
- Consider there is one human player that is playing against the computer.
- Think of how the game would start.
- The first thing you need is something to play the game on, a board!
- How would this board be drawn out.
- What are the dimensions of the board.
- How many rows are needed.
- How many squares are needed.

#### Part 2: Game Logic
- How would the game start.
- How would you determine who goes first.
- Can players  choose to be `X or O` and if so how.
- What happens when players place `X or O` in a box.
- What happens if players try to place a `X or O` in the box that contains a letter.
- What happens if there is a tie.
- How is scoring determined.
- How would players go about matching `X or O`.
- What determines a win.
- How do you set parameters that determine if a player won.


## Instructor Instructions
Begin by instructing the class to collaboratively write down instructions for pseudo solving their game. 

1. If the class is large or an element of competition is desired, the class can be broken into however many groups needed, each of which provides a set of instructions in accordance with the task at hand. 
   
2. A time limit of about 30-45 minutes is appropriate to complete this task. 
   
3. After students complete their programming instructions, inform the class that we will go over their pseudo code. 
   

## Reflection 
After receiving the instructions and going through the activity, questions to highlight:

1. What happened with each groups set of instructions?
2. Were students as detailed as they can be, why or why not?
3. What was the main issue each group faced?
4. What was the hardest part?
5. What was the easiest part?
6. What didn't you think of?
7. What understanding was gained from activity?
8. What are the key takeaways?

## Submission
- You will need to submit an issue this repository with the link to repo with your file.
