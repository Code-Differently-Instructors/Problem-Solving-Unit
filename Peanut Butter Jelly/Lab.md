## Prerequisites
- Programmatic Thinking
- Problem Solving

## The Set Up
- Clone or fork this repository to your Github or you can create a new repository on your Github.
- In the new repository, create a new file called `PB&J.md`
- Copy and paste directions from lab into new file.
- Make sure you are saving along the way.
- Complete the prompt below.
  
## About
This scenario and activity is widely revered for how it has conveyed important computer science concepts to new developers. From this exercise you will learn the necessity for being meticulous while programming and you will find how literal programming can be. As was highlighted in the [Think Like a Programmer lesson](https://github.com/Code-Differently-DevShop-ProblemSolving/Thinking-Like-a-Programmer) that computers are very smart and not smart at the same time, as they need explicit directions for everything. As a programmer, you need to develop the ability to *read between the lines* and determine what was meant because computers do not understand intention, only direction. Here we will learn what it takes for a computer to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

## The Task
In this activity you will pretend the instructor is the computer and you will need to  "program" the instructor to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You need to do the following:

- Write down materials needed to make PB&J.
- Write down how you would program the instructor to make to the PB&J.

## Instructor Instructions
Begin by instructing the class to collaboratively write down instructions for programming the instructor on making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

1. If the class is large or an element of competition is desired, the class can be broken into however many groups needed, each of which provides a set of instructions in accordance with the task at hand. 
   
2. A time limit of about 5 minutes is appropriate to complete this task. 
   
3. After students complete their programming instructions, inform the class that you are a computer and that you are going to follow their instructions. 
   
4. Proceed by interpreting the instructions in the most literal manner possible.

## Reflection 
After receiving the instructions and going through the activity, questions to highlight:

1. What happened with each groups set of instructions?
2. Were students as detailed as they can be, why or why not?
3. What was the main issue each group faced?
4. What was the hardest part?
5. What was the easiest part?
6. What didn't you think of?
7. What understanding was gained from activity?
8. What are the key takeaways?

## Submission
- You will need to submit an issue this repository with the link to repo with your file.
- If you forked this repo, submit a pull request.
