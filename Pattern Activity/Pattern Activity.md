## Prerequisites
- Programmatic Thinking
- Problem Solving

## The Set Up
- Clone or fork this repository to your Github or you can create a new repository on your Github.
- In the new repository, create a new file called `PatternActivity.md`
- Copy and paste directions from lab into new file.
- Make sure you are saving along the way.
- Complete the prompt below.
  
## About
This activity is fun and pretty simple as it teaches you to recognize patterns, where in programming we would call that *loops*. In computer science, a [loop](https://techterms.com/definition/loop#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20loop,functions%2C%20and%20many%20other%20things.) is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things. 

## The Task
In this activity you will pretend the instructor is a robot and that this robot needs food in order to keep functioning. You will write down your instructions that is needed to "program" the instructor robot eat a meal.

## Instructor Instructions
Begin by instructing the class to collaboratively write down instructions for programming the instructor to the aforementioned task. 

1. If the class is large or an element of competition is desired, the class can be broken into however many groups needed, each of which provides a set of instructions in accordance with the task at hand. 
   
2. A time limit of about 5 minutes is appropriate to complete this task. 
   
3. After students complete their programming instructions, inform the class that you are a robot and that you are going to follow their instructions. 
   
4. Proceed by interpreting the instructions in the most literal manner possible.

## Reflection 
After receiving the instructions and going through the activity, questions to highlight:

1. What happened with each groups set of instructions?
2. Were students as detailed as they can be, why or why not?
3. What was the main issue each group faced?
4. What was the hardest part?
5. What was the easiest part?
6. What didn't you think of?
7. Did you notice the repetition?
8. What understanding was gained from activity?
9. What are the key takeaways of fragmenting?

## Submission
- You will need to submit an issue this repository with the link to repo with your file.
- If you forked this repo, submit a pull request.
