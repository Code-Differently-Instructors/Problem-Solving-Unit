## Prerequisites
- Programmatic Thinking
- Problem Solving

## The Set Up
- Clone or fork this repository to your Github or you can create a new repository on your Github.
- In the new repository, create a new file called `SimpleTask.md`
- Copy and paste directions from lab into new file.
- Make sure you are saving along the way.
- Complete the prompt below.
  
## About
This activity is pretty simple where you will "program" the instructor to do simple task. From this exercise you will learn how to fragment, essentially breaking down the task into small and simple steps. 

## The Task
In this activity you will pretend the instructor is a robot. YOu will write down your instructions that is needed to "program" the instructor robot to do one of the following three things:

- Brush their teeth.
- Wash their hands.
- Read a book.

## Instructor Instructions
Begin by instructing the class to collaboratively write down instructions for programming the instructor to do one of the aforementioned task. 

1. If the class is large or an element of competition is desired, the class can be broken into however many groups needed, each of which provides a set of instructions in accordance with the task at hand. 
   
2. A time limit of about 5 minutes is appropriate to complete this task. 
   
3. After students complete their programming instructions, inform the class that you are a robot and that you are going to follow their instructions. 
   
4. Proceed by interpreting the instructions in the most literal manner possible.

## Reflection 
After receiving the instructions and going through the activity, questions to highlight:

1. What happened with each groups set of instructions?
2. Were students as detailed as they can be, why or why not?
3. What was the main issue each group faced?
4. What was the hardest part?
5. What was the easiest part?
6. What didn't you think of?
7. What understanding was gained from activity?
8. What are the key takeaways of fragmenting?

## Submission
