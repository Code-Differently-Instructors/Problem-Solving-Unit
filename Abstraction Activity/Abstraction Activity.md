## Prerequisites
- Programmatic Thinking
- Problem Solving

## The Set Up
- Clone or fork this repository to your Github or you can create a new repository on your Github.
- In the new repository, create a new file called `Abstraction-Activity.md`
- Copy and paste directions from lab into new file.
- Make sure you are saving along the way.
- Complete the prompt below.
- Or you can use a google doc instead of a repository.
  
## About
This activity is fun as we dive into the concept of abstraction. Remember what we said about what abstraction is:
- Abstraction is used to simplify problems in order to manage complexity. With abstraction, one can understand the most important aspects of a problem while disregarding irrelevant aspects. This important information can be used to create a model or blueprint of sorts of the problem you're working with. This model will then be used to create a solution, instead of dealing with all the details at one we focus on the important aspects. 


## Instructor Instructions
Begin by instructing the class to collaboratively write down what is required of them. 

1. If the class is large or an element of competition is desired, the class can be broken into however many groups needed, each of which provides a set of instructions in accordance with the task at hand. 
   
2. A time limit of about 30 minutes is appropriate to complete this task. 
   
3. After students complete their programming instructions, inform the class that you are a robot and that you are going to follow their instructions. 
   
4. Proceed by interpreting the instructions in the most literal manner possible.

## The Task
In this activity we are going to use an activity from Code.org. They have a great way of conveying the concept of abstraction. We are going to break this up into two parts.

#### Part 1: Make a different story
Take the following template below. This started as a specific story about one thing but using abstraction, we turned some of the specific words into blanks and now the story can be about lots of things. You will fill in the blanks with words to create something fun to share and can make your story about what you would like.

**Template:**

`
First you take your ________ then add a layer of ________ before you pour on a hearty dose of ________. Next, press some ________ down into the ________ before covering with a sprinkle of ________. That’s how we make a ________!
`

##### Part 1: Wrap Up
1. What did you learn?
2. How might you be able to use abstraction when describing things outside?
3. Can you think of ways to use abstraction when talking about animals?


#### Part 2: Abstraction Assessment
It seems like the template that we used to make our first stories has disappeared! Look at the
stories below and figure out which words are supposed to be blanks, then recreate them on your own.

##### Story 1
`
Sometime last year, my mom told me an old story. She told me about the days
when she would hear it from her father in her childhood. I tried to tell it once, but tripped over my words. It didn’t take long before I decided that it was best to leave the storytelling to my mom.
`
##### Story 2
`
Early last year, my mom gave me an old skateboard. She told me about the
days when she would ride it from her school in her hometown. I tried to ride it
once, but tripped over my shoelaces. It didn’t take long before I decided that it
was best to leave the skateboarding to my mom.
`


## Reflection 
After receiving the instructions and going through the activity, questions to highlight:

1. What happened with each groups set of instructions?
2. Were students as detailed as they can be, why or why not?
3. What was the main issue each group faced?
4. What was the hardest part?
5. What was the easiest part?
6. What didn't you think of?
7. What understanding of abstraction was gained from activity?
8. What are the key takeaways of abstraction?

## Submission
- You will need to submit an issue this repository with the link to repo with your file.
- If you forked this repo, submit a pull request.
