## About
In this unit we will touch on the aspect of problem solving and the important role it plays in every programmers day to day activities.

## Problem Solving: Importance
Programming is a skill that continuously gives because it teaches and forces you to think, logically and critically. Being a problem solver goes hand in hand with being a software engineer, you can consider it a meta-skill. With that being said, you need to look at software engineering as problem-solving first and coding second simply because computers need to be told exactly what to do with clear and concise details as they are unable to make assumptions like a human would when provided instructions that are vague in nature. Given this understanding, the hardest part of programming is not the languages and frameworks but putting pieces of information together to create something that can be used/useful. 


### Problem Solving: Breakdown of Steps
When it comes to problem solving in programming, you'll want to follow steps in order to successfully solve the problem:

1. Identify and understand the problem.
2. Find the pieces to the *puzzle*, getting the right information.
3. Identify possible solutions to solving the *puzzle*.
4. Test one solution
5. If step 4 does not work, repeat steps 3-4 until problem is solved.

- ***Identify & Understand Problem:*** Remember with programming more often than not you will find that most of the time you are either running into and/or searching for a problem.  
    - First, identify what is the problem.
    - Second, why is this problem occurring. 
    - Third, how is this problem occurring.
    - Fourth, recall similarities from past problems in order to compare/contrast if past solution can be fully or somewhat applicable to current problem.
    - Fifth, identify what is it you are trying to accomplish and desired outcome. 
  
- ***Pieces To The Puzzle:*** This aspect is stems from the notion of gathering information, *finding the pieces to the puzzle*. After identifying the problem using the aforementioned steps, you will need to find, assess, and implement the proper information. 
    - Understanding and using past information to find solution to current problem.
    - Asking the right questions, the how as opposed to the what.
    - Knowing what information is useful vs useless: *All puzzles are not created the same but may possess similarities with one another, causing some pieces to fit in puzzles outside their own.*
    - Lastly, knowing how to apply the information or *pieces* to the puzzle correctly, making sure it fits.
  
- ***Trying Possible Solutions:*** Considering the previous steps, you have identified the problem, gathered information, and now you are ready to put that information to the test. This is the stage where you ponder over your information to provide you with at least one or more possible solutions to the problem at hand. Using the steps below can be beneficial:
    - This is the stage where nothing needs to be perfect, only implemented to see if it succeeds or fails.
    - If a solution does not completely solve the problem but gets you closer to the answer, that is still progression in the right direction.
    - Breaking down the solutions into *pieces* could prove helpful, as you can try certain aspects or, piece by piece, seeing what fits and what doesn't to complete the puzzle.
    - If you find someone or something else may contain the solution to your problem, instead of instantly applying it understand it first and why it works, because you also need to know how to rebuild your puzzle should it ever break or fall to pieces.
    - Lastly, if solution after solution does not seem to solve the problem, try changing the approach to the problem.
  
- ***Documenting Completion:*** When you find the solution to the problem you are solving, as a last step you should document what you did as in what did not work and what did. This will help as continue to face and solve more problems, building up a personal reference resource to help along the way, ultimately cutting time in half when solving problems.

## Solving Problems In Programming
You will find that everything highlighted above is a general way at looking at problem solving, but lets see how we can tailor it to solving problems in and with programming:

1. Speak aloud: This is something almost every developer does as they are identifying the problem they need to solve. You can do this with yourself or using what is called the "rubber ducky method" where in software engineering, rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book *The Pragmatic Programmer* in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Now you don't have explicitly do it this way but the basic idea is to reiterate the problem and/or solution until you have a firm grasp of what you are solving and how to solve it, this also helps if you get stuck as well.
   
2. Teamwork: Developing may look like a silo activity but it truly is a collaborative effort. Leaning on your fellow developers can prove to be beneficial to not only solving problems, but learning different ways to do so. As a developer you are a lifelong learner, and developers enjoy learning from each other. Working with other programmers on complex problems often fosters the best ideas and makes solutions much easier and innovative. One popular aspect to this is something called *pair programming*, where two developers solve a problem together. One developer will write the code while the other developer reviews it and understands how the problem can be broken down and solved. In this aspect both developers will switch roles, allowing for a broader perspective on reaching the same goal but in different ways. This helps to understand that there are multiple ways to achieve the desired outcome, you'll find in programming that its not always about a wrong or right way but a more efficient way. 
   
3. One Step, Piece By Piece: Whether its a small, mid, or big size project, it can be intimidating and overwhelming at first, but remember to identify and assess the problem and then break it down piece by piece.
   
4. Simply Simple: Keep things relatively simple for yourself when doing this, try not to loose yourself in the logic of it all. Start small and work your way up.
   
5. Repetition: The only way to get better as a developer and problem solver is to practice. Repetition is key when it comes to programming as the more you do it the more you understand and you'll find yourself solving problems and programming quicker than when you initially started. 
   
6. Ask Questions: The best and most experienced developers ask questions constantly, and look up the way to do things more often than you may think. Given that it would be almost impossible to know and/or memorize everything in programming, googling what to do is not only a common practice among developers but strongly encouraged and believe it or not the saying goes "Development is 10% what you know and 90% what you ask google". This relates to what was mentioned earlier, sometimes its not about knowing the answer but how to find it.
