## Prerequisites
- Programmatic Thinking
- Problem Solving

## The Set Up
- Clone or fork this repository to your Github or you can create a new repository on your Github.
- In the new repository, create a new file called `RPS.md`
- Copy and paste directions from lab into new file.
- Make sure you are saving along the way.
- Complete the prompt below.
  
## About
One can be certain that most people have played "rock, paper, scissors", whether you were a kid simply having fun or using it to settle disputes of anything.
Here in this activity you will Pseudo Solve "rock, paper, scissors".

## The Task
In this activity we are stepping away from programming the instructor and now you will be planning to program the computer. Rock Paper Scissors is a decision/conditional based game. An example would be if player 1 chooses rock, player 2 would choose paper or if both players choose the same sign its a tie etc. This is the type of programmatic thinking that is needed when developing such a program. 

**Here are some guidelines below to think about:**

- Consider there is one human player that is playing against the computer.
- Think of how the game would start.
- Would the game start with open or closed hands.
- What signs can players choose.
- How would players choose.
- How would players play a sign, would they shake their hand several times before putting out a sign.
- What happens if player chooses rock.
- What happens if player chooses paper.
- What happens if player chooses scissors.
-  What happens if computer chooses rock.
-  What happens if computer chooses paper.
-  What happens if computer chooses scissors.
-  What happens if both play the same sign.

## Instructor Instructions
Begin by instructing the class to collaboratively write down instructions for pseudo solving their game. 

1. If the class is large or an element of competition is desired, the class can be broken into however many groups needed, each of which provides a set of instructions in accordance with the task at hand. 
   
2. A time limit of about 30-60 minutes is appropriate to complete this task. 
   
3. After students complete their programming instructions, inform the class that we will go over their pseudo code. 
   

## Reflection 
After receiving the instructions and going through the activity, questions to highlight:

1. What happened with each groups set of instructions?
2. Were students as detailed as they can be, why or why not?
3. What was the main issue each group faced?
4. What was the hardest part?
5. What was the easiest part?
6. What didn't you think of?
7. What understanding was gained from activity?
8. What are the key takeaways?

## Submission
- You will need to submit an issue this repository with the link to repo with your file.
- If you forked this repo, submit a pull request.
